Is the random methods for different languages are truly random (or at least pseudo-random)?

Let's create a simple program to test the random function in different languages :)

## How to use

Clone the repository and use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com) to install the supported languages.

Run them by calling their scripts:

```
ruby ruby.rb
node javascript.js
```
